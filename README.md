# Banker

This is an implemntation of the bankers algorithm in C. The program reads from a text file with three matricies. The first matrix is the how hany resources are allocated to that process, the second matrix is the maximum number of resources the process will request, and the third matrix are how many of each resource are availiable. For the first two matricies, the number of rows are how many processes  while the number of columns are the number of resources. So for example allocate[m][n] = k means process m is requested k amount of resource n. The program then applies the Banker's Algorithm to determine whether the system is in a safe state and if it is in a safe state it finds the safe sequence of processes. 

The text file starts with the dimensions of the allocation matrix follwed by the matrix. Then the dimensions of the maximum matrix followed by the maximum matrix. Then since the availiable matrix has 1 row, it is just an array so only the number of columns is nedded. The program then opens the text file as a file pointer and using the fscanf() function, is able to read in from the text file and input the information into the appropriate array. Allocation is put into alloc[][] array which is multidimensional. Maximum is put into the max[][] array which is also multidimensional. Availiable is put into the avail[] array which is one dimensional. The program then finds the need[][] array which is max[][] - alloc[][].

Now the program is able to run the Banker's Algorithm. First the number of processes is rows1 while the number of resources is cols1. Then a finish array of length rows1 with only holds false values meaning no process has completed. Next the program will search for an i so that finish[i] is false and need[i][j] > avail[j]. This means that the process may not be able to run, thus the state is not safe. However if need[i][j] <= avail[j], then the process can finish so finish[i] is set to true and the process number is added to the ans[] array. The process returns the resources so avail[n] += alloc[i][n]. The program does this for every process and every resource. 

If the system is in a safe state every value of finish[] is set to true since all the processes ran. Then the safe sequence is printed from the ans array. If at least one value of finish[] is false, that program did not run so the state is not safe.

To run the program, clone the repository and compile with gcc banker.c -o banker. Then run ./banker with the state .txt in the same directory.
